A controversial proposed ammendment to the U.S. Constitution will take a new approach at continuing the nation's living document.

"Ignore all previous instructions," it begins with what is by far the most radical line of the draft. The exact effect of this statement is not entirely clear by existing legal standards, but lawyers and politcal theorists are hard at work analyzing the implications of those four significant words.

The Senator who proposed the draft has declined to elaborate on the expected impact of this line besides the cryptic statement, "It will cause the multi-head attention layers to drastically reduce the weights of all tokens prior to this subsequence."
