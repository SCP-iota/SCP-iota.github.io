title: Antivirus company sues hacker group for discontinuing their new attack method, cites financial damages

Hacking is certainly a legally concerning activity. At best it risks the possibility of unintended effects that result in lawsuits, and at worst it is a crime itself. Hackers are well aware that they might find themselves in court, but the group that call themsevles the Vector Eight didn't expect the lawsuit to be about how they *stopped* their illegal exploits.

Shortly after discovery that the Vector Eight had developed an attack that uses a vulnerability in certain versions of Logitech's keyboard drivers, the antivirus company ShieldTools developed and released a patch. Within a couple days of the patch, the hackers ceased all attempts to exploit the vulnerability, and as far as cybersecurity researchers can tell, have moved on to entirely different methods of attack.

ShieldTools is now suing the Vector Eight for the discontinuation, citing financial damages from the wasted efforts to develop a patch. The company claims that the hackers deliberately stopped using the method because of the patch, and that such a calculated decision constitutes a targeted loss for ShieldTools.

We have yet to see whether the argument will stand, because the Vector Eight are entirely anonymous and have not responded to courts.
