title: Florida man convicted of "idiopathic charges"
---

A 23-year-old man was arrested after an incident in Miami, Florida, followed by a trial that would set an entirely new type of legal precedent. Struggling to figure out how to classify the alleged crime, prosecutors looked to the words of doctors for advice:

> When we see symptoms that seem to indicate some kind of adverse condition but can't be classified as a known diagnosis, we call it an idiopathic disease.

Following this line of thinking, the prosecution decided on a novel approach to justice:

> Since we cannot form a legal argument for this case using existing laws, we are pursuing idiopathic charges. That means we do not fully understand *why* the defendant is guilty, but we are committed to bringing justice nonetheless.

Many legal theorists have criticized what they call the "non-argument," but only the verdict will tell.
