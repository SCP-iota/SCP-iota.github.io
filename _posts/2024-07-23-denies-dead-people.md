You've heard of climate change deniers, gravity deniers, and Australia deniers, but we have just interviewed one man who denies the existence of death:

> It's made up. I've never died in my life, and I'm 43. I've never even talked to a dead person; every person I've met was alive.

He proceeded to describe the conspiracy theory backing his beliefs:

> We're told that if we don't work to survive, we'll die, but like I said, I've never even talked to a person who died. These fakers are lazy - they would rather lay in their coffins than go out and touch grass. They need to get a life.

When our interviewer asked him, "If people never die, how do you explain why the world doesn't overpopulate exponentially?" the man replied,

> Overpopulate? Like, from reproduction? I don't believe that happens either. I've never done that.
